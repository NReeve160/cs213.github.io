<h2>The Crown Keepers</h2>
<p>The Crown Keepers are an adventuring party based in Tal'Dorei, 
    primarily active in 842 and 843 PD.</p>

        <img src="opal.jpg" alt="opal" id="opal_img">
        <h2>Opal</h2>
        <p>Opal has been described as having a shining personality 
            by Ted; she is very charismatic and easy to talk to. She 
            is confident, albeit naive, and puts a lot of effort 
            towards her physical appearance. She can be a bit full of 
            herself, especially when dealing with her sister, and 
            likes to show off.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="dariax">
        <img src="dariax.png" alt="dariax" id="dariax_img">
        <h2>Dariax</h2>
        <p>Dariax is easygoing, reacting cheerfully to being pranked 
            by his friends. However, he becomes intense when he 
            realises he’s being lied to, as he has had bad experiences 
            with people who lie a lot. He is impulsive and prone to 
            throwing himself unthinkingly into dangerous situations.
            Despite his cheerful nature, Dariax is somewhat cynical, 
            considering the world to be built on “fucking people over” 
            and feeling that doing bad things in order to survive is 
            necessary. However, he believes in putting his friends 
            before his own selfish desires, such as when he refused 
            the Spider Queen's offer.</p>

    <div id="dorian">
        <img src="dorian.jpg" alt="dorian" id="dorian_img">
        <h2>Dorian</h2>
        <p>Dorian is well spoken and charismatic. He seems to have 
            come from a very secluded place, and likes to see 
            different kinds of people living together. Dorian 
            appears to have left home to look for a better life, 
            but he often dodges questions about his past, seemingly 
            uncomfortable when talking about it. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="fearne">
        <img src="fearne.jpg" alt="fearne" id="fearne_img">
        <h2>Fearne</h2>
        <p>Fearne has large eyes and large furry ears, and her hooves 
            have bits of moss around them. She wears flowy clothing 
            and is covered in poisonous flowers including hemlock and 
            oleander. She is about 6 feet tall. Fearne is exceptionally 
            calm and collected, always speaking in a very soft voice. 
            She shows great appreciation for nature and is rarely made upset.
            In combat she always goes for the kill.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="orym">
        <img src="orym.png" alt="orym" id="orym_img">
        <h2>Orym</h2>
        <p>Orym is generally serious, dutiful and level-headed. He 
            considers himself responsible for “babysitting” his 
            friends' antics, and makes efforts to protect them in 
            combat. Orym prefers to leave complicated, dangerous 
            matters in the hands of more experienced figures whom he 
            trusts.</p>
