        <h2>Wizards</h2>
        <p>Learn how to bend the powers of the universe to your
            very whims and pleasures! Our wizards go through a 
            curiculum specifically learning how to use the initate
            powers of the universe to cause as much chaos and 
            destruction as is possible! Principal Aguefort highly
            reconds a focus on the study of chronomancy.

        <h2>Sorcerers</h2>
        <p>The innate powers you were born with were given to you for 
            a very specific purpose, to end the lives of your enemies!
            On occasion they may also be used for the purpose of protecting
            the world from chaos and evil. Mostly for the ending of
            your enemies! Learn how to do it best within the sorcerers 
            class!

        <img src="cleric.png" id="cleric" alt="cleric">
        <h2>Clerics</h2>
        <p>Your God has given you very special powers and gifts for 
            the purpose of bringing about their divine will. At 
            Aguefort we say that you do have to do that, because if 
            you don't then you will lose your powers! There is nothing
            that is preventing you from learning the loopholes of your
            religion, or even creating your own GOD! (these views are
            exclusively of the principal Arthur Aguefort)
